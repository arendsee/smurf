# Smurf

This code was based initially on [this](https://gist.github.com/sw17ch/2048516)
cool github gist by John Van Enk.

Then I decided `indents` was way more hassel than it was worth for my purposes.

Now it is evolving towards being the new Morloc parser.

## Installation

``` sh
stack build && stack install && smurf < data/sample1.txt
